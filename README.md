SVF is a static tool that enables scalable and precise interprocedural dependence analysis for C and C++ programs. SVF allows value-flow construction and pointer analysis to be performed iteratively, thereby providing increasingly improved precision for both. 

SVF accepts the points-to information generated by any pointer analysis (e.g., Andersenâ€™s analysis) and constructs an interprocedural memory SSA form so that the def-use chains of both top-level and address-taken variables are captured. SVF is implemented on top of an industry-strength compiler [LLVM](http://llvm.org) (version 6.0.0). SVF contains a third party software package [CUDD-2.5.0](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/) (Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)), which is used to encode path conditions.

### SVF Reachability

Our static reachability tool is implemented at `tools/Reach`. To build, execute the SVF build process above. Once built, you can locate the executable at `BUILD_DIR/bin/svf-reach`.

To use the tool, we require a `.bc` file for both the executable we want to calculate reachability from, and all of its dependendant libraries. Our [dep-trace](https://github.com/petablox/dep-trace/tree/better-symbols) tool aids in building a `.bc` for all of an application's dependencies. Note that for the tool calculates reachability per linkage module, which mostly corresponds to a shared library. 

Currently, on `fir07`, we have pre-built `.bc` files for a few packages. `/data3/pkg-debloating/wllvm-build/wget-src-out/wllvm-bc/` contains `.bc` files for `wget` and its dependencies. The following is an example to use the tool to calculate dependencies reachable from `wget` main function:

```
BUILD_DIR/bin/svf-reach -t type $HOME/dep-trace/srcs/wllvm-build/wget-src-out/wllvm-bc/*.b
```

The above uses class-hierarchy analysis (-t type) option. To use the more precise but slower andersen wave difference analysis, pass the `anders` option instead:

```
BUILD_DIR/bin/svf-reach -t anders $HOME/dep-trace/srcs/wllvm-build/wget-src-out/wllvm-bc/*.bc
```

Lastly, because libraries opened with `dlopen` and invoked with `dlsym` are tricky to trace with static analysis, we have a separate way to trace their usage. We create a module file that includes a list of bc files (shared libraries) where each library will be used as a starting point (including the main function).  Each line in the file should name a `.bc` module with a path as the same path used as input to the tool.  For example, lets say we create `m1.txt`:

```
$HOME/dep-trace/srcs/wllvm-build/wget-src-out/wllvm-bc/libacl.so.1.bc
$HOME/dep-trace/srcs/wllvm-build/wget-src-out/wllvm-bc/libidn2.so.0.bc
```
And run as:

```
BUILD_DIR/bin/svf-reach -t type -m m1.txt $HOME/dep-trace/srcs/wllvm-build/wget-src-out/wllvm-bc/*.bc
```
